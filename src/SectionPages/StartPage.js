            <h1>What is europe?</h1>
            <p><b>Europe</b> -  is a continent comprising the westernmost peninsulas of Eurasia,located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere. It shares the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Africa and Asia. It is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and Asia to the east. Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed of the Ural Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian Sea, the Greater Caucasus, the Black Sea and the waterways of the Turkish Straits.</p>

            <h2>How big is europe</h2>
            <p>Europe covers about 10.18 million km<sup>2</sup> 3.93 million sq mi, or 2% of Earth's surface 6.8% of land area, making it the second-smallest continent using the seven-continent model. Politically, Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states, of which Russia is the largest and most populous, spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population. Europe had a total population of about 745 million about 10% of the world population in 2021. The European climate is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent, even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe. Further from the sea, seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast.</p>

            <h3>European culture</h3>
            <p>European culture is the root of Western civilisation, which traces its lineage back to ancient Greece and ancient Rome. The fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE and the related Migration Period marked the end of Europe's ancient history, and the beginning of the Middle Ages. Renaissance humanism, exploration, art, and science led to the modern era. Since the Age of Discovery, started by Spain and Portugal, Europe played a predominant role in global affairs. Between the 16th and 20th centuries, European powers colonised at various times the Americas, almost all of Africa and Oceania, and the majority of Asia.</p>

            <h4>European Union</h4>
            <p>European Union, EU - an economic and political union of 27 democratic European countries. The Union was established on November 1, 1993 under the Maastricht Treaty signed on February 7, 1992 - as a result of a long-term process of political, economic and social integration. The roots of modern European integration date back to the post-war period and were limited to 6 Western European countries. These countries created many forms and mechanisms of cooperation, established organizations, institutions and bodies whose aim was to strengthen the unity between them. In 1993, the European Union became superior to all previous organizations, receiving a previously unknown hybrid sui generis formula.</p>
